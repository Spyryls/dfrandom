This program generates random GURPS Dungeon Fantasy characters.  It supports
all of the templates from GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 1: Adventurers.  It doesn't
support anything from the other books yet.

You need Python 2.7 (not Python 3) installed.  This program doesn't need
anything else, just libraries that come with Python.

Usage:

python dfrandom.py

will give you a random character from a random template.

python dfrandom.py -t "holy warrior"

will give you a random holy warrior.  (The quotes are only needed for
template names that contain spaces.)

Note that a random character is unlikely to be a very good character.  But
it might provide a decent starting point.
